        <img src="Wireless.jpg" alt="Picture of wireless network">
        <p>Wireless technology <b>provides the ability to communicate between two or more entities
                over distances without the use of wires or cables of any sort.</b>
            This includes communications using radio frequency (RF) as well as infrared (IR) waves .</p>

        <h2>The Different Types of Wireless Communication</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Satellite Communication</li>
            <br>
            <img src="Physics-Images-Satellite-communication-4.png" alt="Picture of Satellite communication">
            <p>Satellite communication is a crucial form of wireless communication.
                By means of satellites, people all over the earth can communicate with each other.
                <br><br>
                It may not be possible to send a signal to another country because, well, the curvature of the earth is
                in the way. This is one reason why satellites are orbiting the earth because they can send a signal
                amongst
                themselves and eventually to the distant country. All of this at an incredibly fast speed.
                <br><br>
                NASA and other space agencies make regular use of this type of technology. Of course, sending a
                satellite into the atmosphere is not cheap. Therefore the technology involved must be subjected to
                significant
                testing before launch. </p>

            <li>Infrared Communication</li>
            <br>
            <img src="Infrared Communication.png" alt="Picture of Infrared Communication">
            <p>Infrared communication is present in most homes in the form of a television remote control. However, how
                does it work?
                <br><br>
                IR transmits information by means of invisible light. This means that on the electromagnetic spectrum it
                lies between microwaves and visible light.
                <br><br>
                Infrared communication requires a transmitter and a photoreceiver to receive the light beam. Since any
                disruption to the light will result in the photoreceiver not receiving it, IR will only function when
                there is a line of sight visibility. That means that if you stand between the transmitter and receiver
                it will
                probably not work. </p>
            <hr>
            <li>Broadcast Radio</li>
            <br>
            <img src="Broadcast Radio.jpg" alt="Picture of Broadcast Radio">
            <p>The most famous form of wireless transmission on our list, broadcast radio, was probably the first kind
                of wireless communication.
                <br><br>
                Radio transmitters send out data in the form of radio waves to receiving antennae. Radio waves are forms
                of electromagnetic signals. Signals are relatively narrow, and waves can be sent across various
                frequencies.
                This is why your car radio is able to receive signals from many different radio stations.
                <br><br>
                There are many types of users of radio communication. Radio stations that send out informative and
                entertaining programs. Maritime radio channels allow ships to communicate with each other and the shore.
                Ham radio enthusiasts are able to communicate and use radio communication for personal use.

            <li>Microwave Communication</li>
            <br>
            <img src="Physics-Images-Satellite-communication-4.png" alt="Picture of Satellite communication">
            <p>Microwave technology is an effective type of communication that is used globally. This technology can be
                broken down into 2 types.
                <br><br>
                <dt>Satellite Microwave Communication</dt>
                <dd>This is the most effective method of transmitting microwaves globally. Like Infrared technologies,
                    Microwave technologies require a clear line of sight. This means that if you want to send a signal
                    over a long
                    distance, sending it up to a satellite first is a good idea.
                    <br>
                    The only problem is that in very dense cloudy weather the signal to the satellite can be blocked by
                    atmospherics.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt>Terrestrial Microwave Communication</dt>
                <dd>Microwave technologies can be a very secure form of communication. If a signal needs to be
                    transmitted over a short distance, it can be enough to erect two antennae with a clear line of
                    sight. The signal can
                    then be transmitted between the two receivers. This negates the need to connect to an outside
                    network.

                    The only problem is that in very dense cloudy weather the signal to the satellite can be blocked by
                    atmospherics.

            <li>Wi-Fi</li>
            <br>
            <img src="Wi-Fi.jpg" alt="Picture of wifi">
            <p>Wi-Fi internet is a low powered wireless electronic network. These are available in almost every
                shopping mall and cafe in the world. Essentially a physical wired network is connected to a router.
                This creates a highly localized and low power wireless network.
                <br><br>
                From this, it is possible to connect a range of devices to the local network. However, public wireless
                internet access is known to be a target for thieves and hackers. Therefore, it is essential that both
                users
                who connect to these networks and the providers use password protection defense methods.

            <li>Mobile Communication Systems</li>
            <br>
            <img src="Mobile Communication Systems.png" alt="Picture of Mobile communicate">
            <p>The burgeoning mobile phone industry uses similar technology to Wi-Fi but on a much grander and
                safer scale.
                Mobile phone companies provide coverage to customers nationwide or even international scale.
                <br><br>
                They do this by means of a complex blend of local networks and transmitters together with satellite
                support.

            <li>Bluetooth Technology</li>
            <br>
            <img src="Bluetooth Technology.png" alt="Picture of Bluetooth Technology">
            <p>Bluetooth is a relatively new technology but is becoming more and more prevalent. It is essentially
                a simple method to send information across a short distance. However, this information can include
                either
                messages or even files.
                <br><br>
                Bluetooth technology was originally designed to be a replacement for physical cables. However, it
                does have its downsides. It has a maximum reach of 30 feet. This can be reduced further, but not
                entirely
                blocked by walls and other solid items.
